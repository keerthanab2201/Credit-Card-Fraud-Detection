# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression on an imbalanced dataset.
Preprocessed transaction data with feature scaling and handled class imbalance using class weighting to improve recall.
Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to ensure high sensitivity to fraud cases.
Visualized performance metrics and fraud detection results for deeper model interpretability and effectiveness.
Converted the project into a reusable Python script for scalability and integration with downstream applications.
